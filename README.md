# 🚀 Higher Level Programming

This repository contains a collection of programming projects covering various aspects of higher-level programming, including Python, JavaScript, and SQL. These projects are part of the Holberton School curriculum and demonstrate fundamental concepts, best practices, and real-world applications in software development. From basic programming principles to advanced topics like object-oriented programming, database management, and web development, each project builds upon previous knowledge to create a comprehensive learning experience. The projects follow industry standards and best practices, incorporating modern development tools, testing frameworks, and documentation requirements. We learn to write clean, maintainable code while understanding important concepts like data structures, algorithms, API development, and database design. The curriculum progresses from simple scripts to complex applications, helping students develop both theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed in today's software industry. Each project includes detailed documentation, test cases, and follows specific coding standards to ensure code quality and maintainability. The repository serves as a portfolio of programming skills, showcasing proficiency in multiple programming paradigms and technologies essential for modern software development.
