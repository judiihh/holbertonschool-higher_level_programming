# Python - Everything is Object 🐍

This project explores Python's object-oriented nature and how it handles different types of objects. It focuses on understanding:

- Objects and their types
- The difference between mutable and immutable objects
- References and assignments
- Variable aliasing
- Object identity and equality
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Requirements 📋

### Python Scripts 📜
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using wc

### .txt Answer Files 📝
- Only one line per file
- No shebang on the first line
- All files should end with a new line

## Learning Objectives 🎯
- Understanding what an object is in Python
- Differentiating between classes and objects/instances
- Understanding mutable vs immutable objects
- Understanding references and assignments
- Understanding aliasing
- Identifying identical variables and linked objects
- Displaying variable identifiers
- Understanding Python's variable passing mechanism

2. Right count - Understanding object references
3. Right count = - More about object references
4. Right count = - Understanding assignment
5. Right count =+ - Understanding operations and references
... and more!
